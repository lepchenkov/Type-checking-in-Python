# Type-checking-in-Python
The notes are based on the lecture of Carl Meyer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMgmKJyWKn8. 

## Why type checking?
Type checking seems to be the trend now, especially with large Python code bases. Companies like Instagram, Dropbox, etc. use type checking extensively. It seems that for small codebases type checking does not make much sense, but sometimes you can meet people that use type checking everywhere, like Joel Grus. So it is worth styding at least.
